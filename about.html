        <h1>OUR STORY</h1>
        <p class="story">Finalmouse is an innovative company that helps introduce freethinking into their way of gaming. Founded in the year 2021, we strive to be the newest company to inspire our customers by being innovative in their own way. E-sport is on a strong upturn and Finalmouse is one of the companies that focuses particularly on everyone who likes to compete. As the name suggests, they make mice for gamers. Although they are designed to be used by professionals, nothing prevents an ordinary so-called "casual gamer" from exploiting all the benefits of their products. After all, everyone wants a light gaming mouse with incredible precision and high quality. 2015 and beyond, Finalmouse has begun to make a strong name in the industry with a number of sharp gaming mice, not least Scream One, Ultralight and Ninja Air58. Their perhaps most innovative gaming mouse is the Ultralight Pro, which is so light that it provides a totally revolutionary gaming experience. The comfort is somewhat out of the ordinary and the low weight favors quick movements that are common in so-called first-person shooters like Counterstrike. </p>
